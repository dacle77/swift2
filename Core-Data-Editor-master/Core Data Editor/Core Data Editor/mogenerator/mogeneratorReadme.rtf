\f0\fs24 \cf2 \cb3 The classes for your model are located in the directory "Human" and "Machine". These files were generated by "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator"}}{\fldrslt mogenerator}}".\
"{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator"}}{\fldrslt mogenerator}} is a command-line tool that, given an .xcdatamodel file, will generate two classes per entity. The first class, _MyEntity, is intended solely for machine consumption and will be continuously overwritten to stay in sync with your data model. The second class, MyEntity, subclasses _MyEntity, won't ever be overwritten and is a great place to put your custom logic."\
